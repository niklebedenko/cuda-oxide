# rustc-codegen-cuda

A custom rustc codegen backend that enables single-source CUDA programming in Rust. It intercepts rustc's code generation phase to split device code from host code -- device functions compile to PTX via the cuda-oxide pipeline, while host code passes through to the standard LLVM backend.

## Why Single-Source?

The alternative is split compilation: kernels live in a separate crate compiled with `#[cfg(cuda_device)]`, requiring two compilation passes, careful type coordination, and `instantiate!` macros for generics. With `rustc-codegen-cuda`, everything compiles in **one pass** -- host code and `#[kernel]` functions coexist in the same crate, share types naturally, and generics just work.

```rust
use cuda_device::{kernel, DisjointSlice};

#[kernel]
pub fn vecadd(a: &[f32], b: &[f32], mut c: DisjointSlice<f32>) {
    if let Some((c_elem, idx)) = c.get_mut_indexed() {
        let i = idx.get();
        *c_elem = a[i] + b[i];
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Host code references the kernel directly.
    // PTX is generated alongside the host binary.
}
```

## How It Works

```

The backend implements rustc's `CodegenBackend` trait. When rustc calls `codegen_crate()`:

1. **Collect** -- `collector.rs` scans codegen units for functions prefixed with `cuda_oxide_kernel_<hash>_` (set by the `#[kernel]` proc-macro -- the prefix is owned by `crates/reserved-oxide-symbols/`, the workspace-internal source of truth for the cuda-oxide naming contract). It then walks the MIR call graph to gather all transitively reachable device functions.
2. **Compile device code** -- `device_codegen.rs` feeds the collected MIR through
   the cuda-oxide pipeline: translate to `dialect-mir`, run `mem2reg`, apply
   annotated unrolling, lower and export to LLVM IR, then compile PTX with `llc`.
3. **Compile host code** -- The standard `rustc_codegen_llvm` backend handles everything else.

## Usage

```bash
# Preferred: use the cargo-oxide wrapper
cargo oxide run vecadd

# Or build without running
cargo oxide build vecadd

# Manual: pass the backend as a rustc flag
RUSTFLAGS="-Z codegen-backend=/path/to/librustc_codegen_cuda.so" cargo run --release
```

### Required Compiler Flags

These are set automatically by `cargo oxide`. For manual invocations, all four are required:

| Flag                                    | Why                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `-C opt-level=3`                        | Enables MIR inlining and const-prop for device code |
| `-C debug-assertions=off`               | Strips debug checks from device code                |
| `-Z mir-enable-passes=-JumpThreading`   | Prevents barrier duplication across branches        |
| `-Z always-encode-mir`                  | Keeps dependency MIR available so the whole-program device collector can compile cross-crate functions that are neither `#[inline]` nor generic (e.g. recursive ones) |

> `panic=abort` is **not** required. The backend treats all unwind paths as unreachable since the CUDA toolchain does not support unwinding today (the hardware could; this is a compiler/runtime limitation).

### Environment Variables

| Variable                             | Effect                                      |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `CUDA_OXIDE_VERBOSE`                 | Verbose compilation output                  |
| `CUDA_OXIDE_PTX_DIR`                 | Output directory for PTX files              |
| `CUDA_OXIDE_TARGET`                  | GPU architecture override                   |
| `CUDA_OXIDE_LLC`                     | Path to a specific `llc`                    |
| `CUDA_OXIDE_DUMP_MIR`                | Dump the `dialect-mir` module               |
| `CUDA_OXIDE_DUMP_LLVM`               | Dump the LLVM dialect module                |
| `CUDA_OXIDE_SHOW_RUSTC_MIR`          | Dump raw rustc MIR                          |
| `CUDA_OXIDE_EMIT_NVVM_IR`            | Emit NVVM IR for libNVVM                    |
| `CUDA_OXIDE_DEVICE_CODEGEN_CRATE`    | Comma-separated device owner crate filter   |
| `CUDA_OXIDE_DEVICE_CODEGEN_ROOTS`    | Comma-separated `owner=export` root filter  |
| `CUDA_OXIDE_DEVICE_CODEGEN_ROOT_DESCRIPTORS` | Newline-separated semantic root filter |
| `CUDA_OXIDE_MONOLITHIC_DEVICE_CODEGEN` | Keep selected owners on LLVM O3           |

`cargo oxide --arch <sm_XX>` sets `CUDA_OXIDE_TARGET`. When it is unset,
PTX output auto-detects the required target from generated LLVM IR.
Owner-filter names are normalized like Cargo crate names, so hyphens match
underscores. Host LLVM codegen still runs for every crate. An excluded target
must not call its generated module loader; the filter suppresses its device
artifact but does not give sibling targets separate runtime bundle names.
Root filters require an explicit owner filter with the same owner set, use
exact exported names, and retain each selected root's complete transitive
device-call closure. Invalid, duplicate, uncovered-owner, or missing roots in a
compiled owner stop compilation instead of falling back to broad device
codegen.
Validation occurs when rustc compiles the selected owner. Build wrappers must
therefore include `CUDA_OXIDE_DEVICE_CODEGEN_ROOTS` in the owner's Cargo
codegen fingerprint so a changed selection cannot reuse a stale owner
artifact; `cargo oxide` includes it automatically.
For durable exact-root catalogs, prefer
`CUDA_OXIDE_DEVICE_CODEGEN_ROOT_DESCRIPTORS`. Each line is
`owner=rust-instance-v1:<fully-qualified kernel instance>`, with ordered,
fully-resolved type and const arguments. The compiler resolves that semantic
identity to the current export before walking the device call graph, rejects
missing or ambiguous identities, and embeds the owner-qualified
descriptor-to-export map in the artifact entry. Anonymous closure, coroutine,
async, and opaque types do not receive v1 descriptors because their displayed
source locations are not stable selector identities. The semantic and raw
selector variables are mutually exclusive; raw selection remains available
for compatibility and emits mappings for stable selected instances so catalogs
can migrate without broad codegen. With `CUDA_OXIDE_VERBOSE=1`, each mapping is
also printed as one `Device-root map` line.
`CUDA_OXIDE_MONOLITHIC_DEVICE_CODEGEN` opts selected materialized owners out of
partitioning so their complete closure is optimized as one LLVM module. It is
restricted to measured, bounded exact-root artifacts and fails closed without
one of the two exact-root selectors; wrappers include it in the same CUDA
environment fingerprint.

Examples starting with `error_` are expected to fail. See [STATUS.md](STATUS.md)
for what each one tests and why it fails.

Run any example with:

```bash
cargo oxide run <example_name>

# See the full compilation pipeline
# (MIR → dialect-mir → LLVM dialect → LLVM IR → PTX)
cargo oxide pipeline <example_name>
```

## Key Design Decisions

- **Device code is `no_std`**. Functions reachable from a `#[kernel]` may only call into `core`, `cuda_device`, or the local crate. Use of `std` or `alloc` is a compile-time error.
- **Arguments are scalarized** at the host/device boundary. Aggregates (slices, structs) are flattened to scalars for the CUDA launch ABI and reconstructed inside the kernel. This is transparent to the user.
- **Struct layout matches rustc exactly**. Device-side structs use explicit padding derived from rustc's layout queries, so `#[repr(C)]` is not required.
- **Closures work**. Both `move` closures (capture by value) and non-move closures (capture by reference via HMM) can be passed to kernels.
- **Unwind paths are unreachable**. The backend ignores all MIR unwind edges, so `panic=abort` and custom sysroots are unnecessary. If a panic condition is hit at runtime, the GPU traps.

### Nightly Rust

The backend uses `#![feature(rustc_private)]` and pins to a specific nightly via `rust-toolchain.toml`. The workspace currently uses `nightly-2026-04-03`.
